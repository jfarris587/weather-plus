# Weather+ React JS Application

This is a ReactJS application for inspecting the weather implementing API with OpenWeather.com. ReactJS was used as the Javascript framework to develop with component-driven code. The app also uses geolocation services to enable users to inspect the weather of their area without searching the city. Else, any city (default United States) can be searched as long as OpenWeather has data for that location.
